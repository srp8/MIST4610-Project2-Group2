## Dataset Description: 

Our first dataset on missing persons cases in the United States provides a comprehensive collection of data focused on geographic and case-specific attributes, offering valuable insights into the distribution of such incidents across the country. Visualized in a map (Sheet 3), the dataset plots cases using geographic coordinates, with additional details like state and case counts highlighted through color and size variations. Although the exact source of the data isn’t specified, it is likely compiled from public records or law enforcement databases, often used for research and trend analysis in missing persons cases. The dataset is structured in a tabular format, potentially containing hundreds or thousands of rows, where each row represents an individual missing persons case. The columns include "STATE," a categorical string field (e.g., "California," "Texas") used to color-code data points by state on the map; "CNT(Case Number)," an integer field indicating the count of cases per location or state, which determines the size of the circles on the map; "Longitude (generated)," a float field representing the longitude in degrees (e.g., -122.4194 for a location in California), used to plot cases along the x-axis; and an implied "Latitude (generated)," also a float, representing latitude in degrees (e.g., 37.7749), used for the y-axis plotting, though not explicitly listed in the interface. The map visualization aggregates this data to show regional patterns, with larger circles indicating higher case counts and distinct colors for each state, revealing concentrations in areas like California, Texas, and the Northeast—possibly reflecting population density or socio-economic factors. This dataset is well-suited for geographic analysis, helping researchers, law enforcement, and policymakers identify hotspots, allocate resources efficiently, and develop targeted strategies to address missing persons cases across the U.S.

The second dataset on missing persons cases in the United States focuses on demographic factors, specifically examining the relationship between race/ethnicity, biological sex, and the average duration individuals remain missing or unidentified, as visualized in a bar chart (Sheet 2). Although the precise source of the data is not provided, it is likely derived from public records, law enforcement databases, or a national missing persons registry, commonly utilized for demographic analysis in such contexts. The dataset is structured in a tabular format, with rows representing aggregated groups of missing persons cases categorized by race/ethnicity and biological sex, though the exact number of rows is not visible in the visualization. The columns include "Race/Ethnicity," a categorical string field listing groups such as "Asian, Hawaiian/Pacific Islander," "American Indian," "White/Caucasian," "Black/African American," "Hispanic/Latino," "Asian," "Hawaiian," and "Black/African American, Hispanic"; "Biological Sex," another categorical string field with values "Female" (represented by red bars) and "Male" (represented by blue bars); and "AVG(Days Since Updated)," a numerical float field indicating the average number of days since the case was last updated, which serves as the y-axis metric on the chart. The bar chart reveals disparities in case duration across demographic groups, with categories like "Asian, Hawaiian/Pacific Islander" showing the longest average duration for both males and females (around 2000 days), while groups like "Hispanic/Latino" and "Asian, Hispanic" have shorter durations (closer to 500 days). The visualization highlights potential vulnerabilities, with females generally showing slightly longer average durations than males across most racial/ethnic groups, providing critical insights for researchers and policymakers aiming to address inequities in missing persons case resolutions. This dataset is well-suited for analyzing demographic influences on case outcomes, supporting the development of targeted interventions to reduce disparities and improve investigative strategies for at-risk populations.


## Questions:

#### *Question 1: Is there a notable geographic pattern or concentration for missing persons cases in the U.S.?*

This question helps us identify where support systems may be failing and highlights larger social and economic issues that could be contributing factors. Areas with higher concentrations of missing person cases may indicate underfunded police departments, limited search-and-rescue teams, or slower emergency responses, all of which can seriously affect how quickly and effectively cases are handled. Additionally this can be connected to the fact that the regions are struggling with poverty, housing instability, or trafficking routesn. Areas facing these challenges could likely be the cause for high disappearance rates indicating this isn’t an isolated problem and these communities are being impacted by higher risks that need to be addressed. By identifying patterns, we can increase funding for local law enforcement,and reallocate resources to areas in need. Also expanding access to local programs and services that can strengthen community support and help prevent future disappearances.

The dataset supports geographic pattern analysis by including specific details such as the city and state where individuals were last seen, making it possible to count cases by region, map trends, and identify areas that may require more attention or resources.

#### *Question 2: Is race/ethnicity significantly correlated with how long someone remains missing or unidentified?*

This question brings attention to possible racial disparities in how missing person cases are treated and highlights how cultural and institutional barriers can delay critical help. Studies have shown that missing persons of color often receive less media coverage and slower responses from authorities, and if these groups remain missing for longer periods, it suggests underlying racial bias. In additiona, some families may be hesitant to report cases due to language barriers, fear of immigration consequences, or mistrust in the justice system. These barriers can delay investigations and reduce the chances of early resolution. Figuring out which groups are most affected can lead to policies that ensure all cases receive equal urgency and attention. Moverover, it can lead to the creation of tools and programs that will make reporting processes easier and build trust between law enforcement and marginalized communities can help families feel safer and more supported.

The dataset supports this type of demographic analysis because it includes fields for race, ethnicity, and case timelines such as the date last seen and updated. This makes it possible to directly compare how long different groups remain missing and to identify potenital patterns of inequality.

## Manipulations: 
In order to answer the second question, the data set had to be manipulated. Originally, not much of the data was quantitative; Tableau provided the only non-categorical measures based on location variables like 'State'. Yet the date strings could be turned into numbers. Taking a copy of DLC and DateModified, we adjusted the data type to make two quantitative measures of time. Then, subtracting DLC from DateModified, we calculated the amount of time since each case was last updated. This is the field we used to plot demographic data against average time spent on cases. 

## Analysis and Results:

#### *Question 1:*

<img width="800" alt="mist_proj2a" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ff7760fe-11bd-4448-9f2b-606285ff3515" />

The visualization to answer the first question included the longtitude and latitude tableau-calculated fields to create a map. States were laid on the map from the dataset in colors. A count of the case numbers is represented by the circles, and the size of the circles shows the higher counts of cases. At first glace, Texas, California, and Florida appear as the states with the highest number of cases. A closer look shows that the cities in those states closest to the coasts and boarders hold the majority of the cases. One explanation for the pattern of cases could be more accessible trafficking routes. This , however, does not explain the larger circle of cases in Tennessee far from boarders and coasts. Another more likely explanation is simply larger populations; the more people exist in one area, the more easily it is that a few get lost or want to be lost. It is also possible that cases are more likely to be reported in the lower regions of those states compared to New York or Pennsylvania where larger populations are a wider variety of cultures that may hesitate to report a missing person out of shame or pride. One final explanation is that the areas with the larger number of cases are also areas in which poverty is more prevelant. Cases are more likely to be reported and unsolved when there aren't enough resources for after school programs and safe infrastructure for walking at night. Law enforcement, as well, isn't as equipped in low-income areas to handle the amount of missing persons, so more cases pile up.
 
Based on the visualization of the places with the highest number of cases, a couple of measures can be taken to prevent the numbers from building. First, resources from states with a lower case count could allocate their available units for missing persons to the cities with more outstanding cases. Preventative measures should also be taken such as promoting awareness to not walk alone and to find safer routes. After school programs to keep kids occupied and supervised while parents work might also lower the amount of new cases. For cases closest to coasts, lookignoutside the U.S. more than in could prove useful for finding missing persons. 

#### *Question 2:*

This bar chart shows the average number of days since a case was last updated, broken down by Race and Ethnicity—serving as a proxy for how long individuals remain missing or unidentified. We can clearly see some disparities here. For instance, Asian and Hawaiian individuals show the longest average durations before their cases are updated, hovering around 2,000 days, which suggests they may be missing for significantly longer periods. On the other hand, Hispanic and Black individuals have much shorter unresolved periods, closer to 500 days, indicating relatively faster updates or case resolutions.

Black and Hispanic individuals may have shorter durations in unresolved missing persons cases for several reasons. One possible explanation is the growing presence of advocacy groups and social media campaigns specifically focused on missing persons from these communities. Over the past decade, organizations and movements have emerged to spotlight disparities in how missing Black and Hispanic individuals are treated, bringing more visibility to their cases and pressuring law enforcement to act more quickly.

On the other hand, In many Asian and Pacific Islander cultures, there is a strong value placed on family honor and avoiding public shame. When someone goes missing, families might hesitate to report it or speak out publicly, fearing community judgment or stigma. This reluctance can delay investigations and reduce media exposure. In addition, there is often a cultural preference for handling problems within the family rather than involving external authorities. This may lead to underreporting or limited engagement with law enforcement and media, slowing down case progress and visibility.

This difference is important because it suggests that not all demographic groups are receiving equal attention or resources when it comes to resolving missing persons cases. These disparities may stem from a variety of factors—such as systemic bias, lower media visibility for certain communities, cultural or language barriers, or differences in how cases are reported and followed up on. This insight is critical, as it highlights real-world inequalities in how missing persons cases are handled. Ideally, findings like these can guide meaningful policy changes, improve outreach in underserved communities, and ensure a more equitable distribution of investigative resources.

Ultimately, the goal is to make sure that every case, regardless of someone’s background, gets the attention and urgency it deserves.
