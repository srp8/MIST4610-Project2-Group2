## Dataset Description: 
Describing your dataset and what data it contains:
Where was it obtained, what are the dimensions of it (rows and columns), what are the various
columns, data types, etc. Describe it in sufficient detail so that an uninformed reader would
understand the dataset.

Our first dataset on missing persons cases in the United States provides a comprehensive collection of data focused on geographic and case-specific attributes, offering valuable insights into the distribution of such incidents across the country. Visualized in a map (Sheet 3), the dataset plots cases using geographic coordinates, with additional details like state and case counts highlighted through color and size variations. Although the exact source of the data isn’t specified, it is likely compiled from public records or law enforcement databases, often used for research and trend analysis in missing persons cases. The dataset is structured in a tabular format, potentially containing hundreds or thousands of rows, where each row represents an individual missing persons case. The columns include "STATE," a categorical string field (e.g., "California," "Texas") used to color-code data points by state on the map; "CNT(Case Number)," an integer field indicating the count of cases per location or state, which determines the size of the circles on the map; "Longitude (generated)," a float field representing the longitude in degrees (e.g., -122.4194 for a location in California), used to plot cases along the x-axis; and an implied "Latitude (generated)," also a float, representing latitude in degrees (e.g., 37.7749), used for the y-axis plotting, though not explicitly listed in the interface. The map visualization aggregates this data to show regional patterns, with larger circles indicating higher case counts and distinct colors for each state, revealing concentrations in areas like California, Texas, and the Northeast—possibly reflecting population density or socio-economic factors. This dataset is well-suited for geographic analysis, helping researchers, law enforcement, and policymakers identify hotspots, allocate resources efficiently, and develop targeted strategies to address missing persons cases across the U.S.


## Questions:

Q1: Is there a notable geographic pattern or concentration for missing persons cases in the U.S.?

Analyzing the geographic distribution of missing persons cases is essential for identifying regional hotspots, trends, and spatial patterns. By visualizing these patterns, stakeholders can gain a deeper understanding of where incidents are most prevalent, allowing for more effective allocation of law enforcement resources, community outreach efforts, and preventive measures. This approach not only highlights areas with higher risks but also supports the development of tailored strategies to address localized factors contributing to disappearances.

Q2: Are there demographic factors significantly correlated with longer periods of individuals remaining unidentified or missing?

Investigating the role of demographic factors—such as age, gender, race, and socioeconomic background—in the duration individuals remain missing or unidentified provides critical insights into systemic disparities and vulnerabilities. This analysis helps uncover patterns in case outcomes, revealing which groups are disproportionately affected and why certain cases may remain unresolved for longer periods. By understanding these dynamics, policymakers and investigators can develop targeted interventions, enhance equity in resource distribution, and implement strategies to improve case resolution rates for at-risk populations.
